 * Loan calculator with error handling
	- Modify the loan calculator to handle inputs (negatives, zeros, or non-numeric input).
	- Allow user to enter multiple loan scenarios and store them in an array for later review.
	CHALLENGE:
		Implement a method that takes an array of different loans and returns the lowest monthly payment.
