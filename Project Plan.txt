1. Loan Calculator with Error Handling
Modify the loan calculator to handle invalid inputs (negatives, zeros, or non-numeric values).
Allow users to enter multiple loan scenarios and store them in an array for later review.
Challenge: Implement a method that takes an array of different loans and returns the lowest monthly payment.

2. Expense Tracker with Categorization, Sorting & AI-Powered Categorization
Allow users to categorize expenses under Rent, Food, Entertainment, Miscellaneous, etc.
Store expenses in an ArrayList (instead of an array for dynamic resizing).
Provide options to:
Sort expenses from highest to lowest.
Get the top 3 most expensive transactions.
AI Integration:
Implement a rule-based expense categorization system using keyword mappings (e.g., “McDonald's” → Food, “Netflix” → Entertainment).
Future Expansion: Upgrade to a Naïve Bayes classifier to predict categories based on past spending patterns.
Challenge: Implement a method that takes an expense category as a parameter and returns the total spent in that category.

3. Savings Goal Estimator with Adjustable Contributions
Instead of fixed savings, let users adjust their monthly contributions dynamically and recalculate in real time.
Offer projections for 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years based on compound interest.
Challenge: Allow users to input a monthly increase in their savings contribution and factor it into the projections.

4. Budget Category Name Analyzer
Reverse and format budget category names in uppercase.
Count vowels and consonants in each category name.

5. Transaction Date Formatting & Validation
Validate that the day, month, and year are within valid limits.
If invalid, prompt users until they enter a correct date.
Challenge: Convert the formatted date into a Unix timestamp for potential database use.

6. Encrypted Password Storage in a File
Encrypt user passwords using a Caesar cipher and store them in a text file.
Allow users to retrieve and decrypt passwords when needed.
Challenge: Add an option to use a unique salt value before encryption for added security.

7. BONUS: Report Generation
At the end of the session, generate a financial summary report with:
Loan details (including highest and lowest monthly payments).
Expense breakdown by category.
Savings projections.
Transaction history with formatted dates.
Write this report to a .txt file for users to save results.
